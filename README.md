# sudip_resume
This repo maintains the resume of Sudip Bhandari

I have used http://www.davidgrant.ca/latex_resume_template as a reference.

While compiling it might show some *.sty files as missing which can be resolved as:
*compile with latex
*Download package from CTAN (http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/38978/how-can-i-manually-install-a-latex-package-debian-ubuntu-linux)

Result will be a resume.dvi file which can be converted to pdf using:
dvipdfm resume.dvi
